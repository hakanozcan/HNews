# HNews

An Angular app that displays the news from NewsAPI.

Technologies used: Angular, Angular Material, NewsAPI, TailWind CSS, TypeScript, HTML, CSS

Application should look like this, but NewsAPI changed the liberties of the free developer keys and now they reject any request using that key that is not coming from localhost. So, I can't show you the app in action.
